# @x-swap-protocol/conedison ðŸ’¡

Utilities for XSwap Protocol front-end development.

## Usage

Utilities are compiled individually by `tsc`, so they should be imported as such:

    import { formatUSDPrice } from '@x-swap-protocol/conedison/format'

Nothing is exported from the top-level. This is intention in order to encourage more modular usage.
